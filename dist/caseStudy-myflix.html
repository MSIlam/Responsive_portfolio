          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            A single-page application designed to facilitate effortless
            searching and filtering of a wide array of films, offering
            comprehensive insights for each. Comprising a backend and two
            frontend clients, the backend serves as the repository for movies
            stored in a database, alongside housing the API facilitating
            interaction with said database. Meanwhile, the frontend clients,
            developed using React and Angular respectively, furnish users with
            an intuitive interface for exploring movies, accessing detailed
            movie information, managing user profiles, and curating lists of
            favorite films.

          <h2>Purpose and Objectives</h2>
          <p>
            Within the framework of a CareerFoundry course aimed at mastering
            full-stack web development, I conceived and developed this personal
            project. The objective was to craft a dynamic, responsive, and
            captivating web application tailored to offer users insights and
            inspiration across a spectrum of movies. The endeavor posed several
            challenges, including constructing an API from the ground up,
            configuring and linking a database, and leveraging prominent
            frontend JavaScript libraries/frameworks such as React and Angular
            to fashion compelling interactive user interfaces. Simultaneously,
            the project was structured to serve as an exemplary portfolio piece
            while acquainting me with typical project requisites such as user
            stories and user flows.

            In total, the project spanned around 2.5 months, notably longer than
            what would typically be expected for a project of this nature in a
            professional setting. However, given its nature as a study project,
            there was a wealth of knowledge to acquire and challenges to
            overcome.

              On the server side, I developed a RESTful API employing Node.js
              and Express, complemented by a non-relational database, MongoDB.
              This API facilitates data retrieval concerning movies and users
              from the database through standard HTTP requests, delivering JSON
              responses. Bridging the API and the database is the business logic
              layer, which utilizes Mongoose for seamless connectivity.
            </p>
            <h4>Authentication</h4>
            <p>
              To prevent any unauthorized CRUD operations, JWT authentication
              was implemented, necessitating users to sign in or sign up.
              Additionally, password hashing was incorporated to ensure that
              even the database manager couldn't access users' passwords.
              Postman was utilized to test the endpoints.

              After establishing the backend, I proceeded to develop the
              frontend, i.e., the user interface, using the React and
              React-Redux. The frontend is designed as a single-page, responsive
              web application (SPA), constructed in accordance with the MVC
              design pattern. It comprises several distinct views: signup,
              login, main view (displaying all movies as cards), movie view
              (providing detailed information about a specific movie), as well
              as a profile view (where users can edit their user data and view
              cards for their favorite movies).
            </p>

            <h4>Learning React</h4>
            <p>
              This was the most significant and challenging aspect of the
              project for me, but it was also incredibly exciting. Starting with
              React presented a steep learning curve, especially compared to
              traditional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The approach to interface
              creation and design is markedly different, requiring extensive
              research, experimentation, and problem-solving. Throughout the
              project, I experimented with both Class and Functional components.
              Ultimately, I found functional components to be more efficient,
              and they became my preferred choice. Initially, grasping the
              React-Redux architecture posed a significant challenge. However,
              through consistent effort, continuous experimentation, and
              invaluable guidance from tutors and mentors, I gained clarity and
              confidence in completing the project.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="case-img">
            <div>
              <img src="../img/CineF2.png" alt="react-image" />
            </div>
            <div>
              <img src="../img/cineFlix-movie.png" alt="react-image" />
            </div>
          </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Angular client</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="case-class">
          <div class="case-text">
            <p>
              Subsequently, I developed another client to access the same API
              and database, this time utilizing the Angular framework. Similar
              to the React client, it is a single-page, responsive web
              application offering much of the same functionality. After
              registration/login, users land on a main view displaying all
              movies, where they can open modals to view details about specific
              movies, genres, or directors. Creating the layout, predominantly
              following Material design principles, provided a fresh experience.
              Despite its complexity, I found Angular's basics surprisingly
              efficient and straightforward. While I anticipated a similar user
              flow as in the React app, Angular's workflow naturally guided me
              toward creating a more streamlined and efficient outcome. However,
              I realized that for smaller projects, Angular's comprehensive
              feature set might be deemed excessive.

          <h2>Challenges and merits</h2>
          <p>
            This project was both my favorite and most challenging endeavor. At
            first, understanding how the server side worked, especially its
            security features and logic layers, was tough. When it comes to the
            client-side, I faced challenges in grasping the infrastructure of
            both React and Angular. Implementing various functionalities
            consumed a significant amount of time. But with lots of reading and
            some help from my tutor, it started to make sense. I don't have a
            clear preference for either React or Angular. Each has its own
            strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the
            specific project's scope and requirements.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            The mFlixApp reflects my progress in learning both backend and
            frontend technologies. It's a responsive movie app packed with
            features, including user authentication and management
            functionalities. Going from writing complex server code and setting
            up databases to creating two cool user interfaces felt like a big
            achievement.
